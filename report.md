# Shifting Rainfall Patterns in Waukesha County, WI: A Seasonal Analysis (2010–2024)

## Introduction

Climate change has increasingly influenced local weather patterns, and precipitation is among the most visible effects. In this report, I analyze rainfall data from five weather stations located across Waukesha County, Wisconsin, to answer a key question: Are the rainy seasons arriving earlier or later in the year over time?

Rainfall timing is critically important to agriculture, water management, and infrastructure planning. If seasonal patterns are shifting, it could indicate changing atmospheric dynamics or altered storm behavior in the region. This analysis uses data from 2010–2024 to examine how precipitation is distributed across seasons, whether certain months are becoming consistently wetter, and whether peak rainfall is occurring earlier or later in the calendar year.


## Figure 1

*Figure 1* shows the total average rainfall per year, broken down by season. Summer consistently contributes the largest share and Winter the smallest. Since 2010, rainfall has been variable but has generally ranged between 25 and 45 inches. The highest year occurred in 2018 and the lowest in 2021. While the overall amount of rainfall has remained relatively consistent, the distribution across seasons plays a critical role in how that water impacts the environment and local communities. For example, high summer rainfall can increase runoff, erosion, and flash flooding risks, especially in areas with limited green infrastructure. If seasonal totals stay steady but shift later into the year, it could alter growing season expectations for local farmers and impact the timing of nutrient applications or harvests. This figure highlights the need to consider not just how much rain falls, but when it falls — a key theme throughout this analysis.
 
## Figure 2

This plot reveals that while Summer remains dominant in terms of average rainfall, Fall and Spring show greater fluctuation over time. Winter rainfall, although consistently lower, also shows a subtle upward trend — possibly hinting at warmer winters allowing for more liquid precipitation instead of snow. Additionally, *Figure 2* shows that trends in the rainfall of one season do not necessarily determine the trends in other seasons that year. For example, in 2014, Summer rainfall peaked while the other seasons dipped, whereas 2022 showed a peak in Winter rainfall with a drop in the others.

These contrasting seasonal patterns suggest increasing interannual variability, which can make it harder to predict and plan around rainfall. For agriculture, this could mean greater uncertainty in planting and harvesting conditions. For infrastructure and natural ecosystems, it means that water resource planning must be seasonally adaptive, not just based on annual averages. This decoupling of seasonal trends reinforces the idea that climate impacts are becoming more irregular and harder to manage using past norms.
 
## Figure 3

*Figure 3* emphasizes that June tends to be the wettest month on average, but rainfall during August and September is far more variable, with some years experiencing significant late-summer precipitation. This variability may reflect shifting seasonal storm patterns or delayed onset of peak moisture conditions. From an agricultural perspective, this has important implications: crops planted with the expectation of early-summer rainfall may suffer if peak moisture arrives too late, potentially stressing plants during key growth stages. Conversely, increased precipitation in August or September may interfere with harvest operations, particularly for crops that require dry conditions for harvesting and storage.

In broader terms, this unpredictability increases the challenge of managing stormwater infrastructure, pest and disease risk, and soil erosion — all of which are tied to not just how much rain falls, but when it does. *Figure 3* reinforces that even though June remains predictably wet, the rest of the late-summer period is becoming less reliable, which supports the hypothesis that rainfall timing is shifting.

## Figure 4

Perhaps the clearest evidence of shifting rainfall patterns, *Figure 4* shows that the peak rainfall month has been trending later in the year. A linear regression line confirms this pattern with a statistically meaningful positive slope, indicating that Waukesha County’s rainiest period has moved from early-summer months like June toward late-summer or early-fall months such as August and September. This shift could reflect changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation, such as later-arriving storm systems or more persistent dry periods early in the summer. The implications are significant: if peak rainfall is occurring later, it could disrupt planting and harvesting cycles, increase the risk of wet harvests, and alter soil moisture availability when crops need it most. From a broader climate resilience perspective, this trend suggests that historical norms for rainfall timing may no longer be reliable, reinforcing the need for adaptive water and land management strategies that respond to when rain falls, not just how much.

## Figure 5

Grouped by 3-year intervals, *Figure 5* provides clear categorical evidence of shifting rainfall patterns. Early periods (2010–2012) show peak rainfall months concentrated around June and July, consistent with historical expectations for summer rainfall in southeastern Wisconsin. However, more recent periods (particularly 2019–2024) show a noticeable shift toward later months, with peaks occurring more frequently in September and even October. This binning approach helps smooth out year-to-year variability and highlights a structural change in seasonal rainfall timing. It supports the idea that Waukesha County is experiencing a delayed rainy season, which aligns with the linear trend observed in Figure 4. This shift may be tied to broader changes in weather systems, such as later arrival of moisture-laden air masses or longer dry spells earlier in the summer.

For agriculture and climate planning, this visualization is especially important. It implies that the rainy season no longer reliably aligns with traditional planting, growth, or harvest windows, and may demand adjustments in crop calendars, infrastructure drainage design, and seasonal forecasting models.

## Conclusion

The analysis of rainfall data from five stations across Waukesha County (2010–2024) reveals notable seasonal trends and a shift in peak precipitation timing. While Summer continues to dominate in terms of total rainfall, there's increasing variability and rainfall presence in Fall. This shift is further supported by a clear trend: the peak rainfall month is moving later in the year, drifting from June/July to August/September in recent years. This trend could signal changes in regional storm patterns, such as delayed onset of convective systems, later arrival of summer moisture systems, and an increased frequency of late-season storm events

These findings may hold important implications for stormwater infrastructure, seasonal weather forecasting, and, importantly, agriculture in Waukesha County. A delay in the rainy season means that crops may experience drier early growing conditions, increasing the need for irrigation or delaying planting. Conversely, increased rainfall in late summer or early fall can disrupt harvest timing, especially for crops like corn and soybeans that rely on dry conditions for ripening and collection. Excess moisture during these stages can also promote fungal diseases and soil compaction, both of which reduce yield quality and farm profitability. Understanding these precipitation trends allows farmers and agricultural planners to adjust planting calendars, select more resilient crop varieties, and invest in better drainage or water management strategies.
